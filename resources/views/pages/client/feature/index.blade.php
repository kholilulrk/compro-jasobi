                            <p>Really like the cleanliness of the design, the documentation and the content-blocks.
                                Obviously it
                                is still a relatively new template (version 1.0.3), so it lacks some features that
                                you'll find in
                                more mature templates. But their support is swift and very co-operative. Kudos!</p>
